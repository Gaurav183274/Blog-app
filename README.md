First i started with setting up React.js and Tailwind CSS, followed by navigating React Router Dom for dynamic pages.
For robust authentication I used JSON Web Tokens and Google OAuth integration, all powered by Redux Toolkit for easy state management.
I tried to Secure both the client and backend for specific pages, like the admin dashboard. Admins gain the ability to effortlessly manage posts, comments, and users, complete with CRUD operations using the MongoDB database. 
The website is meticulously designed to be completely responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices.
Plus, I've added a sleek dark mode to enhance user experience and cater to different preferences.
What sets this project apart is the addition of advanced search functionality. Users can search by title, limit results, and sort through a modern sidebar, utilizing cutting-edge search query techniques with MongoDB. 
Everyone has the ability to leave, edit, and delete their comments on the post pages, fostering an interactive community.
I deployed my fully functional MERN stack blog application for free using the 'render' platform.
